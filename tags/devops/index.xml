      <description>At work, largely we use vmware for our VMs though AWS,Azure and GCP are there in place. OCI certainly is a new comer in the arena but couple of their features are worth trying out. Firstly, I like the way IAM is handled with SQL like syntax (Not a big fan of writing JSON documents with a list full of permissions). The concept of compartment is also good but it could stand in the way of automation especially when starting out.</description>

      <title>The DevOps vs SRE debate</title>

      <description>The DevOps movement began because developers would write code with little understanding of how it would run in production. They would throw this code over the proverbial wall to the operations team, which would be responsible for keeping the applications up and running. This often resulted in tension between the two groups, as each groupâ€™s priorities were misaligned with the needs of the business. DevOps emerged as a culture and a set of practices that aims to reduce the gaps between software development and software operation.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes (commonly referred to as K8s) is an orchestration engine for container technologies such as Docker and rkt that is taking over the DevOps scene in the last couple of years. It is already available on Azure and Google Cloud as a managed service.
Kubernetes can speed up the development process by making easy, automated deployments, updates (rolling-update) and by managing our apps and services with almost zero downtime. It also provides self-healing.</description>
