      <description>So I just decided to try out *** Hugo **** for a change. The migration has been manual but easy. Thanks to the documentation. Most impressive part is the speed, of course.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to add that it&amp;rsquo;s better to keep the front matter to the minimum and avoid unneccessary customizations to keep your site portable between different themes as well as engines. Also I&amp;rsquo;m doing this via a better deployment model(I guess!</description>

      <description>Last week, I suddenly felt the urge to change my personal web hosted in github. I had it running for quite sometime with HTML5 UP but it was time for some change!!
Then I decided to try out Jekyll themes as Github supports it. Turns out there is a huge collection of themes on their site. Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.</description>
